A modification of the Adafruit [guggenHat](http://example.com/ "Adafruit guggenHat project") project code.  

Now you can add default messages for the hat to display and as well some eye candy display on startup. 

Default messages can be interrupted by a bluetooth sent message.  If you send a colon ":" to the hat via bluetooth the default messages will start displaying again with the first message.  

Default messages have their own color and display time length to account for message length variability.  

The license for this code is in the ino file. 

*Enjoy!*
